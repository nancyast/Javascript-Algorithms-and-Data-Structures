// Step 1. Understand the problem:
//      <1> Can I restate the problem in my own word.
//      <2> What are the inputs that go into the problem.
//      <3> What are thr outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
//      <4> Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
//      <5> How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// Step 2. Concrete examples:
//      <1> Start with simple examples
//      <2> Progress to more complex examples
//      <3> Explore examples with empty inputs
//      <4> Explore examples with invalid inputs
// Step 3. Break it down
//      <1>
//      <2>
//      <3>
//      <4>
// Step 4. Solve Or Simplify
//      <1> Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
//      <2> Temporarily ignore th at difficulty
//      <3> Write a simplified solution
//      <4> Then incorporate that difficulty back in
// Step 5. Look back and refactor
// * Refactoring questions:
//      <1> Can you check the result?
//      <2> Can you derive the result differently?
//      <3> Can you inderstand it at a glance?
//      <4> Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
//      <5> Can you think of other ways to refactor?
//      <6> How have other people solved this problem?
